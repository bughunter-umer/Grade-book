# Interactive Web Gradebook

## Overview

This project is an **Interactive Gradebook** that allows users to enter student names, subjects, and marks directly in the browser and instantly calculates:

* Total marks per student
* Average marks per student
* Highest and lowest marks per student
* Letter grades for each subject

The project is implemented using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, making it fully web-based and interactive without requiring Python to run in the terminal.

---

## Features

* **Dynamic input table:** Users can specify the number of students and subjects.
* **Automatic calculation:** Totals, averages, highest/lowest, and grades are calculated instantly.
* **Responsive and styled:** Uses CSS for a clean, professional layout.
* **Browser-based:** No need to install additional software or run scripts manually.

---

## Technologies Used

* **HTML** – Structure of the web page
* **CSS** – Styling and layout
* **JavaScript** – Dynamic functionality and calculations

---

## Installation & Usage

1. **Download or clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. Enter the **number of students** and **number of subjects**, then click **Create Input Table**.
4. Fill in student names and marks in the table.
5. Click **Calculate Results** to see the full gradebook table dynamically.

## How It Works

1. **User Input:** The user enters the number of students and subjects.
2. **Dynamic Table Generation:** JavaScript generates an input table for marks.
3. **Calculations:** When the user clicks **Calculate Results**, JavaScript calculates totals, averages, highest/lowest, and grades.
4. **Results Display:** The results are displayed in a responsive HTML table on the same page.

## Future Improvements

* Allow **custom subject names** instead of “Subject 1, Subject 2…”
* Highlight **top scorer** automatically
* Option to **download results as CSV** for easy record-keeping
* Integration with **Python backend (Flask/Django)** for server-side processing

This README is **detailed and professional**, perfect to include in your GitHub repository.

If you want, I can also **write a version for the Python + Flask + NumPy version** so it looks more like a **real web application project** for your portfolio.

Do you want me to do that too?
